```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
library(dplyr)
library(implan)
```

## Overview

The implan package streamlines the steps otherwise done in Excel:

1. Allocate spending by Implan sector
2. Write Excel tabs (Industry/Commercial) for Implan import
3. Pull all Implan output (csv) into one results table

### Elevator Pitch

Using R makes it easy to scale-up (or down) without the tedious manual editing in Excel. It's also less error-prone because you can write straightforward scripts with built-in checks & summaries.

## Implan Sector Allocation

Results expenditures need to be specified at the correct dimension (Implan sectors). 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(implan)
```
